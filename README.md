# ift1025-tp2

This is the repository containing my term project for the IFT1025 Programming 2 class at Université de Montréal.

This project involves creating a Java client-server application that allows students to register for courses.

- The server and the CLI client were implemented
- A GUI client was added using JavaFX
- The server implements multithreading to support connecting to multiple clients at once
- Everything was properly documented using JavaDoc.
